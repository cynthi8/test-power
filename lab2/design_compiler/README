1. In this directory run a script with 
design_vision -f SCRIPT_NAME

synthesized files are placed in build/

There are 3 scripts for this folder
1. synthesize_design.tcl is the most basic and will only synthesize the design.
2. dc_test.tcl will synthesize the design and insert an internal scan chain.
3. bsd_comp.tcl will take the design from dc_test and insert a TAP controller and boundary scan chain. It is equivalent to Phase 1.
